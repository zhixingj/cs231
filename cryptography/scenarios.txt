1. Alice and Bob first use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to agree on a shared key. Then they use AES. It works because there is no Mal to affect the key exchange process, so the message can be encrypted and decrypted safely through AES, and Eve cannot read the encrypted message, because she doesn't know the shared key.
2. Use public/private key pairs to agree on a common key k. Use k for AES to encrypt M as S_k(M). Use hash function and get D=H(M). Send S_k(M)||D. Bob can compare D and S_k^-1(S_k(M)) to know M and if its modified. Mal cannot know the key in the first place because she doesn't know private keys. So she cannot read/modify AES encrypted message.
3. First, use Diffie-Hellman key exchange to agree on a shared key k. Then use AES to encryt the message M as S_k(M). Use hash function to get D=H(M). Send to Bob S_k(M)||D. Bob can know if it's from Alice and not modified by comparing H(S_k^-1(S_k(M)) and D. Eve cannot read it because she does not know the shared key to get M. It is safe because Eve cannot affect the key exchange process.
